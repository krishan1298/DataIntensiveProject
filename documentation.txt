My data set is called EV Population data. It contains information about
the vehicle, such as the VIN, where it is, make, model, EV type, range,
and other types of information. The hypothesis I will be proving/disproving
is whether consumers prioritize EV range over luxury and performance. To
do this, I will gather the total number of consumers for each model. I will
also add an extra label that would include the vehicle range to test the 
hypothesis. 

I used this command to extract the Model and Electric range of the
EV_Pop_Data.csv:

head -n 1 EV_Pop_Data.csv | cut -d ',' -f 8,11 EV_Pop_Data.csv

This printed out the headers and all rows for its respected column.

I used this command to create a new csv based on the columns I want to process:

awk -F ',' '{print $8 "," $11}' EV_Pop_Data.csv > process.csv

This stored columns 8 and 11 (EV Model and Range) into a new csv called process.csv
I used this command to run my analysis:

awk -F ',' 'NR > 1 {count[$1]++; if ($2 > max_range[$1]) max_range[$1] = $2} END {for (model in count) print model "," count[model] "," (max_range[model] ? max_range[model] : 0)}' process.csv | sort -t ',' -k2,2nr > completed.csv

This command allows me to get the count of each model and then create a new csv file with the model name and number of counts. Additionally, it'll show the range of each model. This will also be sorted from greatest number of counts to least.

awk 'BEGIN {print "model,count,range"} {print}' completed.csv > temp_file && mv temp_file completed.csv   

This command adds headers to the completed.csv.

head -n 5 completed.csv

This command will show the first 5 entries in the completed.csv. Based on my analysis, most people prefer having an EV with higher range. Model Y and Model 3 scored the highest number of counts and they have the highest ranges.
