My data set is called EV Population data. It contains information about
the vehicle, such as the VIN, where it is, make, model, EV type, range,
and other types of information. The hypothesis I will be proving/disproving
is whether consumers prioritize EV range over luxury and performance. To
do this, I will gather the total number of consumers for each model. I will
also add an extra label that would include the vehicle range to test the 
hypothesis. 

I used this command to extract the Model and Electric range of the
EV_Pop_Data.csv:

head -n 1 EV_Pop_Data.csv | cut -d ',' -f 8,11 EV_Pop_Data.csv > process.csv

This created a new csv file with the columns I will use to test my hypothesis.
