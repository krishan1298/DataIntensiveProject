My data set is called EV Population data. It contains information about
the vehicle, such as the VIN, where it is, make, model, EV type, range,
and other types of information. The hypothesis I will be proving/disproving
is whether consumers prioritize EV range over luxury and performance. To
do this, I will gather the total number of consumers for each model and
create a horizontal bar graph. Python will most likely be used to do this.
